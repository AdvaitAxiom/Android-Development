What is Flutter?

    A tool that allows you to build native and cross-platform apps one programming language and codebase.

    Cross-Platform
        A cross-platform (MULTIPLATFORM / PLATFORM INDEPNDENT) computer product or system is a product or system that can work across multiple types of platforms or operating environments. 

        tool eg- Flutter, React Native

    Native
        An app developed exclusively for a single platform using a native-to-the-os language is a Native app.

        tool eg- Android Studio, X Code

    Hybrid
        A blend solution that conssits of both native and web solutions.

        Developers embed the code written with web dev languGES(html, css, js) into a native app using plugins like Apace Cordova orIonic's Capacitor.

        tool eg- Visual Studio, ionic


WHy is Flutter?

How it is betterthan counterparts?

    In case of RaisedButton(),
        If it was native then for ios it will call UIButton and in case of android it will call Widget.Button during runtime.So they will need platform specific component and libary at runtime.

        But in case of Flutter, it doesn't required native component or library to run because it has its own rendering engine.It will directly control every pixel which is drawn(Custom Implementation).

Benefits of Flutter.

    1. Increased time to market speed
    2. Reduced code development time
    3. The potential ability to go beyond mobile
    4. Same UI and Business Logic in All platforms
    5. Custom, Animated UI of any Complexity Available.
    6. Similar to native App performance
    7. Own rendering engine
    8. Simple
